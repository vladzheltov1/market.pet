# TODO
- Fix type misunderstanding: Object.keys(category_ru) will definitely return array of categories, but now the system does not understand that fact. Maybe there's some kind of unclear behaviour of that method in `@/partils/Header/Categories`?
- Finish header dropdown elements: add necessary links
- Add keyboard actions to main header search: search on enter, focus on keydown etc
- Fill `users` "database"
- Implement `filterList()` function in `@/utils/search`
- Implement `findOne()` function in `@/utils/search`
