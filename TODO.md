- Fix type misunderstanding: Object.keys(category_ru) will definitely return array of categories, but now the system does not understand that fact. Maybe there's some kind of unclear behaviour of that method in /partils/Header/Categories?
- Find a better way to assemble a search link in /utils/search - assembleSearchLink()
